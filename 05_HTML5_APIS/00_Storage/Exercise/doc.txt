        - Include jQuery from CDN jQuery.
        - Create a form
            - Create an input text to insert the description of the task.
            - Create an input submit button to send the form.
        - Create a list that will contains the TODO-List items.
    - Create a todolist.js file
        - Create a document ready event.
            - Set an event handler on click in list (HTML) that will use delegation to listen
              clicks in items. (Toggle effect)
                - When click in items should modify it's done value to its contrary value and strikethrough
                  the task description if is done and remove it if not.
            - Set an event handler on submit form that should avoid the reload of the page.
                - Get the value from input and create an object with two properties:
                    - name -> string
                    - done -> boolean (false by default)
                - Store the object in one array of tasks.
                - Set the array in localStorage using JSON.stringify.
                - Add the new item in list (HTML).
            - When the page is loaded it should try to retrieve data from localStorage using JSON.parse
              and then create the list with all the tasks de-serializing the original objects.
